# SnailPack
A minecraft 1.16.3 anarchy resourcepack for all seasnail enthusiasts!
Mostly custom made (some skidded) textures centered around anarchy servers and crystal pvp. I would recommend using the pack paired with optifine to get the custom sky although please note it is not required also optifine bad i just like cool sky. The pack includes custom armor and entity models along with over 120 custom item textures. Also includes a few animated textures such as the 1024x1024 totem and ender pearl textures. The pack should work for 1.15 although all of the testing i have done has been in 1.16. Please suggest additions and changes to help me improve the pack and i hope you enjoy using it to ez some kids ;)
